# email_spam_classifier

📧 <b>Email Spam Detection using Naive Bayes Classifiers :</b>
<br>A machine learning project that detects whether an email is spam or not spam using three different types of Naive Bayes algorithms: GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, and BernoulliNB. The project also includes a pairplot visualization to analyze feature distribution with respect to the target (spam/ham).<br>

🔍<b> Project Overview : </b>
<br>This project focuses on building and comparing the performance of three Naive Bayes models for binary classification of emails into spam and non-spam categories. The dataset used is preprocessed to extract relevant textual features, followed by model training and evaluation.

💡 <b>Key Features :</b>
<br>Preprocessing of text data: tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization.<br>
Implementation of:<br>
GaussianNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes)<br>
MultinomialNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes)<br>
BernoulliNB (Bernoulli Naive Bayes)<br>

📈<b>Model Comparison Based On : </b>
<br>Accuracy<br>
Precision<br>
Recall<br>
F1-score<br>
Confusion Matrix<br>

📊 Pairplot visualization using seaborn with hue='target' to show feature distributions.
